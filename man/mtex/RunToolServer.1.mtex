\section{Name}

RunToolServer - the Vesta-2 server for launching encapsulated tools

\section{Synopsis}

\bf{RunToolServer}

\section{Description}

The RunToolServer is the Vesta server process responsible for lauching
tools (such as compilers and linkers) outside the Vesta system. It is
usually run as a background process.  It must be run as the special
"runtool" user (usually with the login \tt{vruntool}), which is
specified by \link{repository.8.html#Configuration}{the repository
configuration value \tt{[Repository]runtool_user}}.

The vesta(1) evaluator contacts a RunToolServer via Remote Procedure
Call (RPC) whenever it needs to launch a tool. Tools launched by the
RunToolServer are run in an encapsulated environment in which all
references to the file system are trapped by the Vesta repository and
recorded as dependencies by the Vesta evaluator.

The Vesta evaluator chooses which RunToolServer process to contact
based on the build target platform name passed to the \tt{_run_tool}
primitive.  Attributes of the platform and candidate hosts are looked
up in the [Evaluator] section of the Vesta configuration file.  The
host on which the evaluator itself is running is preferred.  See the
\link{vesta.1.html#configuration}{vesta(1)} man page for details.

In the event that a Vesta evaluator is killed, a background thread
in the RunToolServer will kill any tools launched by such evaluators
by sending the tools a SIGTERM signal. Normally, such tools would
terminate on their own, but the background ``child killer'' thread is
useful for reaping long- or infinitely-running children.

\section{Configuration Variables}

Like most Vesta-2 applications, the RunToolServer reads site-specific
configuration information from a Vesta-2 \it{configuration file} named
\it{vesta.cfg}. The RunToolServer first looks for this file in the
current directory; if none is found there, it looks in your home
directory.

The configuration file is divided into a number of sections, denoted
in the file by \tt{[}\it{SectionName}\tt{]}. The variables used by the
RunToolServer are in the section denoted by \tt{[Run_Tool]}. Here
are the variables and their meanings; the types of the variables are
shown in parentheses.

\begin{description}
\item{SRPC_port (integer)}
The port number on which the RunToolServer exports its RPC interface.

\item{server_max_threads (integer)}
The maximum number of tools that can be launched and running
simultaneously by the RunToolServer.

\item{server_max_pending (integer)}
When the server_max_threads limit is reached, launch requests remain
pending in a queue.  The server_max_pending value specifies the
maximum size of the queue before a tool request is rejected with a
``server busy'' error.  Note that even when the server is holding some
tool requests pending, it still responds to information queries.

\item{helper (string)}
Specifies the complete pathname of the privileged program used to
launch a tool. The helper program must have root privileges in order
to execute the chroot(2) system call. Currently, the helper program
is named ``tool_launcher''.

\item{helper_switches (string)}
Switches passed to the helper program. The current helper program
(i.e., ``tool_launcher'') understands two switches: \bf{-t} (testing
mode), which causes tool_launcher not to execute the chroot(2) system
call; and \bf{-d} (debugging mode), which causes tool_launcher to
print debugging output to the standard output each time a tool is
launched or completes execution.

\item{sysname (string)}
\item{release (string)}
\item{version (string)}
These values describe the operating system on
which the server will run tools.  They should normally \it{not} be
set in the configuration file; the RunToolServer will get the correct
values from the uname(2) system call.

\item{machine (string)}
\item{cpus (int)}
\item{cpuMHz (int)}
\item{memKB (int)}
These values describe the hardware platform on
which the server will run tools.  They should normally \it{not} be
set in the configuration file; the RunToolServer will get the correct
value from the uname(2) and getsysinfo(2) system calls.

\item{sync_after_tool (integer)}
After a tool exits, issue the sync() system call the given number of
times before returning control to the evaluator.  The default is
currently 1.  

This feature is meant to work around a problem that may cause large
tool output files to be incompletely written under heavy load.  NFS is
supposed to provide write-through on close semantics, but it seems
that the Tru64 Unix kernel may only schedule the write-back to start
immediately, not actually wait until it is complete.  Or at least,
this may be happening in the special case where a process exits and
its files are automatically closed; its parent may be told that it has
exited before all the data has been flushed through to the NFS server.

Even calling sync() does not necessarily fix this problem, as its
specification does not guarantee that writes are complete when it
returns, only that they are scheduled to be started immediately.
Historically people have called sync() two or three times in an
attempt to work around this limitation, but it is not clear that this
actually makes any difference.

Also, sync() is expensive on a shared machine where other file writing
is being done.  Therefore, it may be preferable to set sync_after_tool
to zero and instead modify tools that write very large files to call
fsync() before closing them; or if the files are memory-mapped, to
call msync() before unmapping them.

\item{coredumpsize_limit (integer)}
If set, causes the RunToolServer to change the soft limit on core dump
size at startup.  This limit is inherited by all tools started by the
RunToolServer, so this value can be used to set limits on the ability
of tools to create core dump files.

If set to zero, the core dump size limit will be set to zero,
effectively disabling core dumps.  If set to a negative value, the
core dump size limit will be set to the maximum possible value.  If
set to a value greater than zero, the core dump size limit will be set
to the specified value or the maximum possible value, whichever is
lower.
\end{description}

\section{Environment Variables}

If set, the following environment variables can be used for debugging
purposes.  They cause the RunToolServer to pause at one point or
another during tool execution, print the name under which the tool's
encapsulated file system is mounted, and wait until you hit enter
before continuing.  This gives you a chance to cd into the
encapsulated file system from a shell and look at its contents.  If
you modify anything in the file system, you'll get a non-reproducible
build, so beware!

\begin{description}
\item{STOP_BEFORE_TOOL}
Stop just before each tool execution.

\item{STOP_AFTER_TOOL}
Stop just after each tool execution.

\item{STOP_AFTER_TOOL_SIGNALED}
Stop just after any tool execution that was terminated by a signal.
The terminating signal is printed.

\item{STOP_AFTER_TOOL_ERROR}
Stop just after any tool execution that was not terminated 
by a signal, but did exit with nonzero status.
The exit status is printed.
