\section{\anchor{Description}{Description}}

The \bf{vid} command prints out access control information about
users.  It gets this information from the repository, which makes it
possible to determine exactly what permissions a user has.  It can be
useful for debugging permissions problems.

\bf{vid} prints out several pieces of information:

\begin{itemize}
\item The user's global name and aliases are displayed one per line.
These are represented as global usernames (\it{user}@\it{realm}).
(The first name listed is the global name about which the request was
made.)
\item The user's group memberships are displayed one per line.  These
are represented as global group names (^\it{group}@\it{realm}).
\item The user's UNIX user id.  (This is the user id used in the NFS
interface for anything owned by the user.  For non-local users, this
will be \tt{[Repository]vforeign_uid}.)
\item The user's UNIX primary group id.
\item Any special powers granted to the user are displayed.
Specically, these include: \tt{root} (the user is
\tt{[Repository]root_user}), \tt{admin} (this user has administrator
access), \tt{wizard} (this user has wizard access), \tt{runtool} (this
user is \tt{[Repository]runtool_user}),
\end{itemize}

Users with administrator access may inquire about any user.  The
optional \it{user} may be specified either as a global username
(\it{user}@\it{realm}) or as a local username without a realm, in
which case the local realm will be assumed.

If you are inquiring about yourself at the local repository (the -R
option is not used), \bf{vid} will check that your user ID on the
client machine matches the user ID that the repository has for you.
If it doesn't (which probably indicates a misconfiguration), a warning
will be printed.

\bf{vid} returns status 0 for success, 1 for configuration errors, and
2 for network or permissions errors.

\section{\anchor{Flags}{Flags}}

\begin{description}
\item{\anchor{-R}{-R \it{repos}}}
Make the request for user information to \it{repos} instead of the
default local repository.  The repository is specified by host name
and TCP port number in the format \it{host}\tt{:}\it{port}.  The
\tt{:}\it{port} portion may be omitted; it defaults to
\link{#Configuration}{\it{[Repository]VestaSourceSRPC_port}}.
\end{description}

\section{\anchor{ExamplesSect}{Examples}}

Sample output for a normal user:

\begin{verbatim}
% vid
User names and aliases:
  john@smith.org
  jsmith@example.com
Groups:
  ^john@smith.org
  ^vesta@smith.org
  ^staff@example.com
  ^users@example.com
Unix (NFS) user ID:          1012
Unix (NFS) primary group ID: 1015
\end{verbatim}

Sample output for an administrator inquiring about the wizard user:

\begin{verbatim}
# vid vwizard 
User names and aliases:
  vwizard@example.com
Groups:
  ^vadmin@example.com
  ^vesta@example.com
Unix (NFS) user ID:          1002
Unix (NFS) primary group ID: 1003
Special permissions:
  admin
  wizard
\end{verbatim}

\section{\anchor{Configuration}{Configuration}}


The following values are obtained from the \tt{[UserInterface]} section of the
Vesta configuration file (vesta.cfg).

\begin{description}
\item{\it{realm} (optional)}
If set, specifies the default realm to be used with an unqualified
\it{user} argument (i.e. one containing no "@").  (If not set,
\tt{[Repository]realm} is used.)
\end{description}

The following values are obtained from the \tt{[Repository]} section of the
Vesta configuration file.
\begin{description}
\item{\it{VestaSourceSRPC_host}}
The host name of the default (local) repository.
\item{\it{VestaSourceSRPC_port}}
The default TCP port number for repositories.
\item{\it{realm}}
If \tt{[UserInterface]realm is not set}, specifies the default realm
to be used with an unqualified \it{user} argument
\end{description}

\section{\anchor{Limitations}{Limitations}}

To inquire about any user (even yourself), you must be granted access
to the repository.  If you have no access, you cannot make inquiries.

As mentioned above, normal users can only inquire about themselves.
Administrators can inquire about anyone.
